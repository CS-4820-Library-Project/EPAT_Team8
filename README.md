# Projects and Issues 
## Issues 
For those who aren't familiar - Issues in GitHub are a way to organize and delegate tasks. I have set up some basic issues based on our project plan, but will be added more (and you are welcome to add or edit!). Issues are found under the issues tab at the top, or from [this link](https://github.com/eppenney/eBook-Perpetual-Access-Rights-Tracker/issues).
## Projects 
I have set up a basic project using GitHubs iteration format. This seperates work into iterations, which are pretty much the same as sprints. Issues are assigned to the iterations, and with the project view you can see all issues made for the current, next, and previous sprint, as well as their state (Backlog, In-Progress, In-Review, or Compelete). You can mark tasks assigned to you as complete by dragging them from one column to the next. The project is found under the projects tab at the top, or from [this link](https://github.com/eppenney/eBook-Perpetual-Access-Rights-Tracker/projects).
